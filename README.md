# Fullstack Ecommerce Application

Welcome to the Awesome Ecommerce Application!



## Development Process

Developed the application following best practices to ensure high quality code and functionality across the different application layers.
To adhere to industry standards and best practices, I decided to follow a **test-driven development** approach, creating **unit**,
**integration**, and **end-to-end tests**. My goal was to achieve a high test coverage percentage without sacrificing in code quality.
Below is a list of further development approaches I took and the reason behind them.

- **DTO Implementation:** Application makes use of data transfer objects to separate client data from business data and prevent exposure of sensitive data.
- **Custom Exception Handling:** @RestControllerAdvice is used to handle all application exceptions and provide the client consistent responses.
  - [Reflectoring.io - Exception Handling Techniques](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-exception-handling/)
- **Automated DTO Conversion:** Used Mapstruct to automate conversion from DTOs to business objects and vice versa. All conversions were tested.
- **Object Mother Design Pattern:** Implemented this pattern to get pre-defined objects to use in tests, have consistent objects across tests, reduce code for creation of objects in tests,
    and ensure that every test runs with fresh data.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/stay-fcsd/fullstack-ecommerce-store`

2. Set up the backend:

    - Install Java 17.

    - Maven is optional as the repository includes the maven wrapper

    - Set up needed dependencies like PostgreSQL by running `docker-compose up` in the base directory.

    - Build and run the Spring Boot application: `mvn spring-boot:run`

3. Set up the frontend:

    - Install Node.js and npm.

    - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`

    - Install dependencies: `npm install`

    - Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev`
